       vegetarian meal made from layers of rice, macaroni, and lentils, topped with spicy tomato sauce,
        garlic-vinegar sauce (Daqqa), chickpeas, and crispy fried onions, creating a unique mix of textures and sweet,
         spicy, and tangy flavors, popular as street food and in restaurants alike</p>
