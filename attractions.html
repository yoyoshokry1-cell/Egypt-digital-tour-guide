      <h3> Pyramids</h3>
      <p>Pyramids are ancient, monumental structures, famous for those in Egypt (like the Giza complex) built as tombs for pharaohs, featuring triangular
             sides converging to a point, with the Great Pyramid of Khufu being the largest and oldest surviving Ancient Wonder. Built with immense stone blocks 
             using ramps and levers, they were part of larger complexes with temples and causeways, evolving from step pyramids (like Djoser's) to smooth-sided true 
             pyramids, representing incredible feats of engineering and ancient civilization.

     <h3>Khan el-Khalili</h3>
      <p>Khan el-Khalili is Cairo's historic, sprawling medieval bazaar, established in the 14th century by Mamluk Prince Jaharkas al-Khalili, known for its 
        labyrinthine alleys filled with artisan shops selling spices, jewelry, textiles, lanterns, and souvenirs, all set amidst stunning Islamic architecture, 
        serving as a vibrant cultural hub and major tourist spot near Al-Azhar Mosque and Al-Hussein Mosque. It's a lively place to experience traditional Egyptian 
        commerce, haggle for goods, and soak in centuries of history, with distinct areas for gold, copper, and spices. </p>

    <h3> The Nile River</h3>
      <p>
The Nile River, the world's longest river, flows north through northeastern Africa, vital for life in Egypt and Sudan, originating from distant sources in
 Burundi/Rwanda (White Nile) and Ethiopia (Blue Nile) that meet in Khartoum, Sudan, before emptying into the Mediterranean Sea via a delta, providing water, 
 irrigation, and fertile silt for civilization for millennia.
